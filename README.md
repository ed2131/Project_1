## Introduction
With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, there have been significant shifts in the job market. Our project aims to understand these shifts, especially in the realm of data analysis jobs.

## Project Scope

### Job Title Analysis (Yu Chang)
1. Identify the job titles in demand in the AI sector and the associated salary brackets.
2. Track the evolution of the average salary for the 3 most in-demand job titles over the past 4 years, highlighting any significant trends or anomalies.

### Remote Work Analysis (Nestor Pardo)
3. Understand the dynamics of remote work: How has the rise of AI influenced remote job opportunities and their associated salaries?
4. Explore the correlation between an employee's place of residence and their preference or opportunity for remote work.

### Salary Analysis (Edrin Ngadze)
5. Break down the salary distribution based on employment type in AI: part-time, full-time, and casual roles.
6. Analyse the influence of experience on salary: Does more experience always equate to a higher salary in the AI sector?
7. Investigate if company size plays a role in determining salary: Do larger companies pay more?

### Data Cleaning (All Group Members)
- Our first step will involve data cleaning to ensure the accuracy of our analysis. This includes:
  - Removing duplicate entries.
  - Handling and imputing missing data.
  - Standardizing data formats and units.

### Data Analysis
- We will utilize and manipulate Data Frames to analyse and standardize our dataset. we will also deduce findings to answer our questions.

### Visualizations
- To make our data more informative and visually appealing, we will create:
  - Line charts to track changes over time.
  - Bar charts for visual comparisons.
  - Bar plots to to illustrate the spread in our datasets.
  - Pie charts for distribution insights.

### Final Report
- At the conclusion of our analysis, we will compile a comprehensive report summarizing our findings for presentation in class.

## Data Source
- **Data Resource**: Cedric Aubin (Mar 04, 2023). AI/ML Salaries. Kaggle.com
- [AI/ML Salaries Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cedricaubin/ai-ml-salaries)
  - This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides a rich collection of data on Data Science job salaries spanning from 2020 to 2023. It will serve as the backbone of our analysis.

## Conclusion
We believe that this project will shed light on the evolving landscape of data analysis jobs in the age of AI. Our findings will be instrumental for both employers and job seekers in the AI sector.
